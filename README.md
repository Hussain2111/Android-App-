# Flightscry-UI
This is an android app for Skyscanner named Flightscry. 
As part of my work simulation on Forage, I developed a user interface which allows the user to view their flight details including:
1). The flight number
2). The times at both destination and arrival
3). The airport codes for both the destination and arrival.
